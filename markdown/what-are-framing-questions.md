When conducting [[user
research]{.underline}](http://tymerry.com/getting-started-with-user-research/)
it is important to start on the right foot. A good starting point is to
define what exactly it is you want to accomplish through this research.
This is where framing questions come into play. Framing questions
normally follow the format of \"5Ws and an H\". These questions have
been around for quite some time normally used by reports these questions
answer who, what, when, where, why, and how.

-   **Who?** - \"Who\" questions help determining your prospective
    > audience helps you define demographics and baseline criteria for
    > recruiting.

-   **What?** - \"What\" questions help clarify what actions a person
    > takes. These could be when dealing with a situation that you hope
    > your solution is solving, or actually working with your product.

-   **When?** - \"When\" questions give you timing and usage insights.
    > Is the expectation that people will use your product as part of a
    > routine? after a trigger? How long will they use it?

-   **Where?** - \"Where\" questions give context. These will let you
    > know a lot about the users technological and timing limitations.

-   **Why?** - \"Why\" questions give emotional insight and rational
    > drivers for a persons behavior.

-   **How?** - \"How\" questions give detail into explicit steps and
    > actions people take to solve a problem and reach their goals.

Using these questions you can set your objective questions you would
like answered in your [[user
research]{.underline}](https://www.tymerry.com/what-are-framing-questions/tymerry.com/getting-started-with-user-research/).

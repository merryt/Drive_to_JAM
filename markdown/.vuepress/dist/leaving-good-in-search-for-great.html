  </div> <div class="content"><p>I was living a dream situation, I was working with my friends, getting
paid more than I ever had, and building something I felt had value. On
Maslows pyramid I was pulling up on 4 or 5.</p> <p>Then one Wednesday everything changed, we had a big company meeting, my
whole team was called into a meeting. As someone who has worked for a
couple start ups what came next was pretty expected. The company was
doing okay, but in order to get profitable and stay profitable we going
to need to cut the roster down. They started to hand out packets, I was
the last in line, by the time they got to me, they had ran out. The VP
looked at me surprised, and told me that I shouldn't be in the room.</p> <p>This was the only time I have ever been fired, and it was only for 10
minutes. The next thirty minutes was unorthodox to say the least. The
company culture was really great, the executive team did everything
possible to form a family, and most of us really ate it up. We got
together for family dinners, we hung out together in free time, and
happy hours never felt forced or awkward. So the next thirty minutes
were as expected a family divorce. I credit the CEO so much, he owned up
to everything and was there apologizing and offering any help he could
give to the new job hunters.</p> <p>Post family break up things started changing, mostly good things. I was
put on a team where I was learning a ton, I was given a lot of autonomy,
I was given the opportunity to make a different group of friends. This
isn't to say it was all good. the team I was on had a mostly negative
attitude. In between the nearly constant complaints there was an error
of disdain for the job.</p> <p>As one who was left behind I struggled intensely with survivors guilt.
Every morning for a month as I woke up asking my self &quot;did they make a
mistake choosing not to fire me?&quot; And every evening before falling
asleep I would ponder &quot;why was everyone on my team except me fired, why
me?&quot;</p> <p>There is an old phrase that goes &quot;You are the average of the five
people you are closest to.&quot; I had 5 positive smart people who I spent
everyday with these people, and in a single day that number dropped to 1
and was replaced by a stack of negative people. Over the next couple
months I noticed myself picking up their attitude. People outside of
work started asking me what was wrong in my life, and that I seemed to
be really depressed.</p> <p>As I examined my life I realized I love the work I do, and autonomy the
job offered. On the flip side being surrounded by smart, yet
argumentative people who enjoyed complaining more then working was
slowly yet surely seeping into my personality.</p> <p>It was with that realization I came to the conclusion I needed to
attempt to leave good in search of great.</p></div></div></div></div>

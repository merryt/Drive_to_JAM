  </div> <div class="content"><p>For the past three years I have focused the majority of my energy onto
the goal of achieving financial independence as quickly as possible.
Financial independence is reducing your spending to a point where you
can save ~28 times as much as you spend every year. You save this money
in low cost index funds, real estate, or other investments that can give
you an average return. In the 5 years since graduating from Campbell
University I have managed to pay off my ~27k of student loans, stock up
35k in retirement savings, and buy a condo walking distance from my
current job. Over the past year however I have become more complacent
with my situation in life. I try my &quot;best,&quot; but the fire to improve is
gone. I have a calm that comes from &quot;in 20 years this will all be
behind me. This calm has lead to a decreased desire to learn, and an
increased desire slow down, and watch TV.</p> <p>Although I have enjoyed the internal feeling of &quot;I see the light at the
end of the tunnel&quot; I don't believe it is what is best for me, or what
will get me there fastest. I am instead going to stop my focus on
financial independence, and instead focus on building, and with building
will come knowledge.</p> <blockquote><p><em>The person who dies with the most toys will be second to the person
who lives with the most knowledge.</em></p></blockquote> <p>I seem to accomplish a moment of satisfaction when I build something...
Could be anything, but the act of creation seems to give me happiness.
The hard part is that most of the time it's a lot of work, but that
seems to make all the difference. So new life goal: Learn to enjoy extra
work because it helps me build things.</p></div></div></div></div>

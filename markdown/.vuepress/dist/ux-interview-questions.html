I realized pretty quick questions I like to have answered and the questions I like to ask. Normally during interviews, I don't ask ALL of these questions. I do however treat the categories as an outline and like to make sure each category is represented befor making a hire. SO for categories like &quot;skills&quot; I can ask questions, or if their portfolio clearly answers my questions I will skip this category.</p> <p>Working on teams</p> <ul><li><p>What design team size do you think is ideal? Describe the roles you would expect each person to have.</p></li> <li><p>Describe a time when business goals or technical limitations didn't align with good design or ux. How did you handle it?</p></li> <li><p>Tell me about a time you took ownership of a product or design.</p></li></ul> <p>Design languages and patterns</p> <ul><li><p>If I was building an app for iOS and Android, would you recommend I design a custom experience for each platform or a consistent experience across platforms? Why? (No answer is the only wrong answer, they should be passionate about a decision, but also able to articulate the pros on the cons of both)</p></li> <li><p>What are the pros and cons of having a style guide for a website/app?</p></li> <li><p>Have you built a style guide from scratch?</p></li> <li><p>Tell me about a time you uses someone else's existing design language.</p></li> <li><p>What are some differences in (or what do you like about) googles material design, apples human interface guidelines (HIG), and Microsoft's metro design?</p></li></ul> <p>Their process</p> <ul><li><p>What is your IDEAL end to end design process?</p></li> <li><p>What kinds of design problems do you enjoy solving</p></li> <li><p>If you are given a timeline that doesn't allow for your ideal process what do you do? (I am looking for them to push back a little, but ultimately cut parts out of their ideal process and give reason behind those decisions)</p></li></ul> <p>Research</p> <ul><li><p>Describe a good and bad experience you have had recruiting for user testing.</p></li> <li><p>Tell me about your experience with qualitative research.</p></li> <li><p>Tell me about your experience with quantitative studies.</p></li> <li><p>How do you determine how much and what kind of data you need? when do you do a qualitative study, when do you do a quantitative study? How many participants do you need?</p></li></ul> <p>Skills</p> <ul><li><p>Have you built any accessible websites? describe what you and the team did. (I am looking for more than just alt tags on images, I want to hear them talking about wcag levels)</p></li> <li><p>What tool(s) do you spend most of your time in?</p></li> <li><p>What project are you most proud of?</p></li></ul> <p>Personal questions</p> <ul><li><p>I am new to UX, what book would you recommend me reading to get started? (They should have a book or two that they have recommended to other people in their organizations in the past)</p></li> <li><p>What do you think will be the next big trend in software (or ux design)?</p></li> <li><p>What design trend in the past few years do you think sucks?</p></li> <li><p>Tell me about a project (or part of a project) that went wrong.</p></li></ul></div> <div class="bio-line content"><div class="author" data-v-6f0bb3d0><div class="author-img" data-v-6f0bb3d0></div> <div class="author-content" data-v-6f0bb3d0><h3 data-v-6f0bb3d0>Author</h3> <h2 data-v-6f0bb3d0>Tyler Merry</h2></div></div></div></div></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>

This means that you shouldn't ask a user if they would like a new feature, because chances are, they can't comprehend it, and if they can, their vision won't match yours.</p></li> <li><p>Query Effect - People will make up an opinion on anything if asked to do so. Be careful that you can get users to comment at great length about something that they don't care about.</p></li> <li><p>Leading questions - A leading question is when the question you ask gives the user direction in a way to answer the question. For example: if you are asking about visual design, colors will come up, but most users likely doesn't care about the colors.

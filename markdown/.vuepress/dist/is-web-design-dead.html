The Grid has a really impactful product video that was created by the ever powerful sandwich video.</p> <p>This product is still early stages, so before I toss aside my sketch/cc account I want to see how the product actually works in production. Without a working demo, they are selling vaporware, all product video, no product. This isn't the first demo video for a similar service, but they rarely come to fruition. The idea that &quot;impactful&quot; design can be automated is still a bit out. A coworker built an evolutionary algorithm to help with just one small aspect of the web design, ITS AWESOME, but it took awhile to make, and is a small part of design. IMHO, The problem with replacing human designers with AI systems is that the ranking algorithms for what is good design is a work in progress. It will happen eventually, but for now I think we should feel comfortable with our superiority over our binary counterparts.</p></div> <div class="bio-line content"><div class="author" data-v-6f0bb3d0><div class="author-img" data-v-6f0bb3d0></div> <div class="author-content" data-v-6f0bb3d0><h3 data-v-6f0bb3d0>Author</h3> <h2 data-v-6f0bb3d0>Tyler Merry</h2></div></div></div></div></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>

they use a system called the &quot;research learning spiral.&quot; This spiral
has 5 distinct steps. The first 3 have a goal of formulating and
answering questions so you know what you need to learn during your
research. The goal of these three stages is to build a <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/01/26/ux-research-plan-stakeholders-love/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[research
plan]{.underline}<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>
that you can present to your stakeholders. Once you have sign off on
your research plan you can start actually doing the research which is
the final two steps of the plan.</p> <ol><li><p>Objectives - What question(s) are we trying to answer?!Use [[framing</p> <blockquote><p>questions]{.underline}](http://www.tymerry.com/what-are-framing-questions/)
to facilitate this discussion. After you have your framing
questions picked out you should cluster them into categories and
convert them to research categories.</p></blockquote></li> <li><p>Hypotheses - What do we think we already know? This part of our plan</p> <blockquote><p>should include both guesses about their behavior and potential
solutions we have to accomplish their needs. Your Hypotheses
should be single statements like &quot;Breakdancers like to dance on
streets that have both foot traffic and history&quot;</p></blockquote></li> <li><p>Methods - How we plan to fill the gaps in our knowledge and answer</p> <blockquote><p>the questions to prove our hypotheses.</p></blockquote></li> <li><p>Conduct - Gather data through the methods we've selected.</p></li> <li><p>Synthesize - Take the data we gained and apply it to our objectives,</p> <blockquote><p>and hypotheses to discover what opportunities and implications
exist for our design efforts.</p></blockquote></li></ol> <blockquote><p><em>&quot;It is built to be replicable and can fit into any part of the design
process. It is used to help designers answer questions and overcome
obstacles when trying to understand what direction to take when
creating or moving a design forward.&quot;</em></p></blockquote> <p>This process can be as formal or as informal as possible. Imagine you
are sitting in a room of strangers, you assume that one or two of them
shares your interest in breakdancing. You ask a sweeping question if any
of them like to breakdance, and follow up with more detailed questions
about breakdancing. You take notes of who likes breakdancing, and how
much experience they have. Next time you are about to lay down your you
can use the information gained to invite along some new b-boys.</p> <p>This process can also be very formal. When conducting research for a
project you will need to be more detailed and diligent about each step
in the process.</p> <p><em>The sources for this research are</em> <em>[Smashing Magazine: A Five-Step

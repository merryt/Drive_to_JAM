Imagine you are sitting in a room of strangers, you assume that one or two of them shares your interest in breakdancing. You ask a sweeping question if any of them like to breakdance, and follow up with more detailed questions about breakdancing. You take notes of who likes breakdancing, and how much experience they have. Next time you are about to lay down your you can use the information gained to invite along some new b-boys.</p> <p>This process can also be very formal. When conducting research for a project you will need to be more detailed and diligent about each step in the process.</p> <p><em>The sources for this research are</em> <em>[Smashing Magazine: A Five-Step Process For Conducting User Research]</em></p></div> <div class="bio-line content"><div class="author" data-v-6f0bb3d0><div class="author-img" data-v-6f0bb3d0></div> <div class="author-content" data-v-6f0bb3d0><h3 data-v-6f0bb3d0>Author</h3> <h2 data-v-6f0bb3d0>Tyler Merry</h2></div></div></div></div></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>

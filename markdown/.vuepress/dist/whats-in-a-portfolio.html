  </div> <div class="content"><p>I received a question today that reads:</p> <p><em>I have a question regarding portfolios.</em></p> <p><em>I have a line on a possible job, and they are asking for one. Bad news
is that I don't have one yet.</em></p> <p><em>I am currently collecting work that I have done in the past, but I am
not sure what employers look for.</em></p> <p><em>Any suggestions or resources?</em></p> <p>I am of the principle that one portfolio is enough to get a conversation
going, but in order to get the job and create the most confidence for
your employer you should consider having 2 or potentially 3 portfolios.</p> <ol><li><p>Personal portfolio. The personal portfolio should be projects you</p> <blockquote><p>have enjoyed working on and you believe came out well. Of all the
portfolios you have, this is the most generic. This can be varying
sizes, from 3 or 4 pieces on the small side, to hundreds on the
large size. Normally there isn't really a focus for the TYPE of
work, so you will see everything from T-Shirt design, to model
airplane painting, to ux, to cooking, to photography. For example
check out

portfolio your career portfolio. This portfolio should start to
develop a specific focus that aligns with the jobs you are looking
for. If you are building a portfolio for UX it should show your
end to end process. This means a couple pictures of you conducting
interviews, followed by some example personas, and journey maps.
Then perhaps some wireframes, and lastly a couple screen shots of
the finished products. For example:
(UX)<a href="http://michaelthomaswilson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[http://michaelthomaswilson.com/]{.underline}<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>
(web)[http://www.mattashwood.com/]{.underline}</p></blockquote></li> <li><p>Job focused portfolio. When you get a specific job you are looking</p> <blockquote><p>for, chances are they have a specific set of requirements. This is
your opportunity to set yourself apart from the compilation. Use
the job description as a todo list for your portfolio, everything
listed as a requirement and &quot;nice to have&quot; in the job
description should be represented in the portfolio.</p></blockquote></li></ol> <p>Having all three isn't essential to getting a job. That being said, an
employer will always feel like you care, and are willing to go the extra
mile when then receive a link to yoururl.com/their-company/ or a PDF
portfolio with their logo, and a copy of your cover letter in it.</p></div></div></div></div>

  </div> <div class="content"><p><strong>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</strong> - A summary of the history of debt, and
how it has helped form a modern society. I loved their hypothesis that
debt predated money, and how it is a social construct.</p> <p><strong>Glock</strong> - History of the manufacture of the popular gun. It was a
really compelling story that I appreciated listening to in an attempt to
learn more about the passionate fan base.</p> <p><strong>Kludge</strong> - Examination of some weird parts of the human mind, and why
these weird things are in place. Very much a case for evolutionary
psychology. It encouraged me to keep my mind open to common mistakes I
make, like not understanding large numbers, not being good at
estimating, and with the idea that being a hypocrite isn't the worst
thing in the world. I also try to pay closer attention to my opinions
and figure out if they are part of a larger bias.</p> <p><strong>Antifragile</strong> - This book is about the idea of building things that
are the more sustainable long term. The core is that most things in life
are fragile, they break, they don't go as plan, and eventually are no
longer valuable. Most of the time the path of least resistance isn't
the best. For someone who is trying to save for Financial Independence,
there was a compelling section on investing. It kinda rocked my world,
but I ultimately came to the conclusion that reducing your spending and
living off less is an anti-fragile pattern. Having extra money is just a
byproduct of living less than average. It also encouraged me to spend
more time/money/energy on improving my self and skills, then just
putting more money into my taxable investing account.</p> <p><strong>Why Buddhism is true</strong> - Several of my friends read this book before
me, and more or less forced me to read it ;p ... I also listened to
several interviews with Robert Wright the author in advance. This is
another evolutionary psychology book that makes a very compelling case
for meditation, and mindfulness. The title is a bit salacious in my
opinion, but I guess that is what we do with books these days. The book
was more about the assumptions Buddhism makes about the human condition.</p> <p><strong>The Opposite of Woe</strong> - The autobiography of the Gov of Colorado was a
fun book Randi and I read while traveling. It was interesting to listen
to someone's humble Journey from losing his Father, and Father figure
during childhood, to becoming the Governor of Colorado</p> <p><strong>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a FCK</strong> - Learn what is important to you,
focus on that. Try your best to not get tied up in stuff that doesn't
make you happy, there is plenty of stuff to worry about, and you
will... Try to make sure it is something that matters to you.</p></div></div></div></div>

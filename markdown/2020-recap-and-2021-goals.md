2020 was a rough year for a lot of people, luckily I was able to stay mostly healthy for the year. Both Randi and I kept jobs, and our investments did average, which ended up being pretty good.



What my 2019 goals were and how I grade my performance.





Something\'s I would like to accomplish in 2020

**Meditate 180 days** - I meditated \~80 times. I think

**Publish 12 blog posts** - Def didn't happen, I think published 1 post, but made a new blogging system, so life of a developer.

**Read 12 books** - I finished 6 books, which makes me feel good, the year before I finished 52, which was exhausting, and I thought that after that I wouldn't want to read again. I also realized in my 52 book slog that a lot of the gains from reading a book are in the first 25%, so forcing yourself through books you don't care about only helps you feel superior to others and makes you a bit less fun to talk to.

**Build 1 online product, could be free or paid -** We kept working on poopbets!







Some things I accomplished:



Got a job offer to Amazon which I turned down.

Helped Randi at metro caring, and built a little web app for them using vue.

Crossed a financial milestone I had been working toward for years.

Randi and I realized two people working from home in a studio wasn't working for us and moved into a spacious 1 bedroom.

Biked independence pass, Vailpass, lookout mountain, did a century ride, and mt. evans



I also fractured my kneecap which resulted in my being in a immobilizer for 6 weeks. (currently recovering from that.)
